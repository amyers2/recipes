## Ingredients

- Empty milk jug
- 5 garlic cloves
- 1 teaspoon crushed red peppers
- 1 gallon water
- 1 tablespoon dish soap (or 10 drops of Tween-20)

## Directions

1. To make the repellent fill an old milk jug with water, add 5 crushed garlic cloves, a teaspoon of crushed red peppers (you can save a packet from the pizza delivery) and 1 tablespoon of dish soap.
2. Shake well; then let it sit in the sun for a day or two to ensure the water is saturated with the flavors and smells.
3. Shake well, then spray or pour the deterrent on the plants you donâ€™t want the rabbits to eat.

Once you mix the ingredients, let it sit for at least 6 hours in the sun before applying it to plants. Use this organic rabbit-repellent recipe to deter rabbits from eating your flowers. Reapply after a rain.
