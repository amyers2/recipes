**Serving:** 6 servings | **Prep Time:** 15 mins | **Cook Time:** 45 mins | **Total Time:** 1 hour

## Ingredients

- 8 ounces wide egg noodles
- 1 ½ pounds ground beef
- 1 large sweet onion, peeled and chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 1 eight ounce can tomato sauce
- 1 cup small curd cottage cheese
- 4 ounces cream cheese, cut into ½ inch cubes
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 and spray a 2 quart casserole with cooking spray.
2. Cook up the egg noodles according to package directions (usually around 8 minutes).
3. Sauté beef, onions and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes.
4. Stir in tomato sauce, cottage cheese and cream cheese and cook another 2-3 minutes until fully combined. It’s okay if the cream cheese isn’t fully melted…a few chunks are good!
5. Add cooked noodles and pepper to the skillet, stir to combine and pour the whole mixture into the prepared casserole. Sprinkle cheddar evenly on top.
6. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until bubbling and a little browned. Cool for about 5 minutes and serve!

## Notes

**Ground Beef:** We like the extra flavor that you get from using 80/20 fat percentage ground beef, but you can use leaner ground beef if you like.

**Cream Cheese:** Your cream cheese will be easier to cut into cubes if you do it while it is still cold from the fridge.

**Cheddar Cheese:** You can use mild, sharp or extra sharp – we love sharp, but use your favorite!
