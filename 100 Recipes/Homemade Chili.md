## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 lb ground beef
- 15 oz can kidney beans
- 15 oz can black beans
- 32 oz can diced tomatoes
- 6 oz can tomato paste

### Chili seasoning

- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ⅛ tsp cayenne powder (has been modified)
- ¼ tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp onion powder
- ½ Tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- ½ tsp freshly ground pepper

## Instructions

1. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Add both to a large pot with the olive oil and cook over medium heat until they are soft and transparent. Add the ground beef and continue to sauté until the beef is fully browned.
2. Drain the beans and add them to the pot along with the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, 1 cup water, and all of the ingredients for the chili seasoning. Stir until well combined. Place a lid on the pot and allow it to simmer over a low flame for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally (the flavor gets better the longer it simmers).
3. Give the chili one final taste, adjust the salt or seasonings if needed, then serve hot with your favorite toppings.
