## Ingredients

### Base

- 1 ½ cups almond flour
- 3 Tbsp granulated sweetener
- 5 Tbsp butter, melted

### Filling

- 4 cups cream cheese
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup granulated sweetener
- 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 2 cups sour cream

## Directions

1. Put all of the ingredients for the base in a large bowl and mix them together. Now press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch loose bottomed round cake tin and set aside.
2. Beat the cream cheese until it is light and fluffy using an electric whisk if you have one. Next add in the sweetener and beat to combine.
3. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing after each addition, then add in the lemon juice followed by the sour cream. Keep mixing until everything has been fully combined.
4. Pour the creamy filling over the crust and spread it as evenly as possible. Preheat oven to 350°F and bake for 1 hours and 15 minutes. Once cooked, leave it in the oven with the oven door open for around an hour.
5. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely before popping it into the fridge. Make sure to chill the cheesecake in the fridge overnight before serving.
