## Hydrogen Peroxide Uses

### Blood Stains

To remove, pour peroxide on the spot and let it sit for a few minutes. Then rub and rinse with cold water. 

### Clothes

To whiten, add a cup of peroxide to your wash. Peroxide is more mild than bleach and will keep your clothes from wearing out as fast. 

### Ring Around the Collar

To remove, spray the area with a mixture of 2 parts peroxide and 1 part liquid detergent. Let it sit for an hour before rinsing. *Works great on armpit stains too*.

## Freshen Towels and Get Rid of Mildew Stink

Wash your load of towels on the hot cycle and add 1 cup of vinegar to the load. Do not use anything else, just hot water and the vinegar. If there's still a smell, rewash with just hot water and ½ cup of baking soda. Again, just use the baking soda and hot water, nothing else. Then, throw the towels in the dryer like normal. 

Just be careful with the hot water and mixing colors because you don’t want the colors to bleed.

## Remove Underarm Stains

### Baking Soda 

Pre-treating clothes with a paste made from 4 tablespoons baking soda and ¼ cup warm water can help vanquish a variety of stains. For example, rub it into shirts to remove perspiration stains; for really bad stains, let the paste dry for about two hours before washing. Rub out tar stains by applying the paste and washing in plain baking soda. For collar stains, rub in paste and add a bit of vinegar as you’re putting the shirt in the wash. 

### Salt

Salt’s the secret to getting rid of those stubborn yellow perspiration stains on shirts. Dissolve 4 tablespoons salt in 1 quart (1 liter) hot water. Just sponge the garment with the solution until the stain disappears. 

### Vinegar

Want to see those sweat marks disappear from shirts and garments? Just pour a bit of vinegar directly onto the stain, and rub it into the fabric before placing the item in the wash. You can also remove deodorant stains from your washable shirts and blouses by gently rubbing the spot with undiluted vinegar before laundering.
