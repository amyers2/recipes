## Instructions

1. Melt butter on medium in a saucepan.
2. Once butter is melted, add in flour and stir together.
3. Cook butter/flour mixture for at least a minute.
4. Slowly add in some milk, making sure to stir thoroughly.
5. Once the mixture thickens, add in some more milk.
6. Add in the salt and pepper, stir.
7. Once the mixture thickens again, add in more and more milk.
