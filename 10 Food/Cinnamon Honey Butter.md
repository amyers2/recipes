## Ingredients

- 8 Tbsp butter, softened
- 2 Tbsp honey
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon

## Instructions

1. Cut the butter into chunks, then place in the jar you will store the final mixture in.
2. Microwave the butter until it is just soft enough to be able to stir, but not liquid.
3. Add all ingredients to the softened butter and stir to combine.
4. Refrigerate covered until ready to use.
5. To soften straight out of the fridge, heat in the microwave for 10 sec at a time, until you start to see the butter at the top melting, then stop, stir, and eat.
