## Ingredients

- 1 lb grass-fed ground beef
- ¾ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp (heaping) pepper
- ½ tsp onion powder
- Sliced cheese
- Olive oil (for cooking, just a little bit)
- Sprouted bread (for buns, toasted)

## New Instructions

1. Make patties with just the meat, very flat and wide.
2. Add spices to the top and bottom of the burger.
3. Place on pan as its heating up.
4. Make sure to flip the first time early, just to get both sides cooked early on.
5. Then, flip burger every minute or two, covering the pan to hold the heat in, repeating until internal temp is about 165.
6. On the final flip, top with cheese, cover for 30 seconds to a minute, then take off the pan.

## Old Instructions

1. Mix ingredients in a bowl.
2. Make four patties, very flat and wide.
3. Cook on first side for 4 minutes, flip, then cook for 3 minutes.
4. With 30-40 seconds left, put cheese on top - only on burgers eaten the same day.
5. Serve on bread.

## Reheating Leftovers

4. Place on buns.
