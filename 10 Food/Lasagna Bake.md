## Ingredients

- 1 lb. ground beef
- ½ lb. Italian sausage
- ¼ cup chopped white onion
- 1½ cup marinara sauce
- ¾ tsp. garlic powder
- 1 tsp. oregano
- ½ cup ricotta cheese
- 1½ cup (6 oz.) mozzarella cheese
- ⅔ cup Parmesan cheese
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Chopped parsley, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400˚F. In a 12-inch oven safe pan, brown the ground beef and ground sausage together over medium heat on the stovetop until no pink remains (about 15 minutes). Drain the excess fat and return to heat.
2. Add the onion to the pan and sauté with meat until it begins to soften, 3-5 minutes. Pour the sauce, ½ tsp. oregano, and ½ tsp. garlic powder into the pan with the meat sauce and allow to simmer for 5 minutes.
3. In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, 1 cup of mozzarella, and ⅓ cup of parmesan. Add a bit of salt and pepper to taste and add ½ tsp. oregano and ¼ tsp. garlic powder to the cheese mixture and fold until completely combined.
4. Turn off the heat and spread the meat around the pan until it’s an even layer. Place spoonfuls of the cheese mixture around the pan, pushing them down a bit with a spoon to the bottom of the pan.
5. Sprinkle the top with remaining ½ cup mozzarella and ⅓ parmesan cheese. Bake for 20 minutes until bubbling and top begins to turn golden. Garnish with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve warm.
