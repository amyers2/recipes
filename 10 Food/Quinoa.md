## Ingredients

- As much quinoa as you want to make.
- Salt to taste.

## Instructions

1. Put a lot of water in a large pot.  Maybe more than you think you need.  Excess will be drained later.
2. Start heating the water to a boil.
3. Rinse the quinoa.
4. You can put the quinoa in now, or after the water starts boiling.
5. Once the water starts boiling, cook the quinoa for 10 minutes.
6. Turn off heat.
7. Drain the quinoa using a fine mesh strainer.
	1. If you don't have one, put on a lid and tip the pan upside down until water mostly stops trickling out.  This is not for the weak - it takes a few minutes and good wrist and arm muscles.
8. With the quinoa still in the pan, top it with a lid and let it steam in its own residual heat for 10 minutes (burner still off).
9. Take the lid off and fluff with a fork (or whatever).
10. Serve.
