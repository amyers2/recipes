## Ingredients

- 1 cup avocado oil
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- ½ tsp Dijon mustard
- ¼ tsp salt

## Instructions

1. In a wide mouth mason jar, add all the ingredients.
2. Insert the immersion blender all the way to the bottom, trapping the egg yolk within the blade. Blend on high. Leave the immersion blender on the bottom for about 20-30 seconds, until the whole bottom is white. Then, slowly lift it up. Continue blending until the mixture has thickened to the desired amount.
3. Taste for flavor and add more salt or lemon juice, if desired.
4. Store in jar. Will keep refrigerated for about 2 weeks.
