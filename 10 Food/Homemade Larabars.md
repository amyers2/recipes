## Directions

1. Finely chop all ingredients in a food processor, one at a time, with the dates going in last.
2. Before adding the dates, remove all the pits.
3. At the end of blending, if not sticking together well enough, add just a tad bit of water, then blend again, until mixture no longer moves.
4. Pour mixture onto a sheet of parchment paper, and form into a flat square, about ½” thick.
5. Lay other side of parchment paper on top of the flat mixture, and flatten evenly with the bottom of a pan.
6. Put parchment paper and mixture in the fridge to harden for several hours.
7. Cut into 10 bars and wrap individually using plastic wrap, and store for later.
