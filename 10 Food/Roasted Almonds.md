## Ingredients

- *(2.5 qt Pyrex mixing bowl)*
- 4½ cups raw, whole almonds (1 lb. 8 oz.)
- 1½ tablespoons HOT water
- 1½ teaspoons sea salt
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil
- sea salt to taste

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 375° and line a large baking sheet with silicone or parchment. Place the raw almonds in a large metal or ceramic mixing bowl.
2. Stir 1½ teaspoon of salt into the hot water until mostly dissolved, pour over the nuts in the bowl and mix until all are coated.
3. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, spreading the nuts in a single layer.
4. Bake for about 10 minutes, stir well and spread back into a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes more. To test doneness, the nuts should be nicely browned, inside and out. Keep an eye on them, this is when they can burn quickly - but you don’t want them undercooked either or they won’t be crisp.
5. When they are done baking, put the hot nuts back into the large bowl and pour the avocado oil over them. Toss well until all the nuts are coated, shaking on sea salt as you go. You can taste one, but they’re very hot, so be careful.
6. Leave the nuts to cool in the bowl, or spread out on the pan again if you need them to cool more quickly. The nuts will soak up the oil as they cool.
7. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
